# Tabletop RPG Campaign Scaffolder

This web app is intended to assist Dungeon Masters with creating campaigns by handling the bones of a campaign by generating maps, characters, relationships between NPC's, etc.

The created assets are randomized from a variety of user-set options and constraints.

# Currently Planned Features

- NPC Generator - Creates NPC's with names, alignments, personalities, quirks, and other traits.
- NPC Relationship Generator - Creates relationships between groups of NPC's to create more organic, interconnected locations.
- Map Generator - Creates randomized maps for artificial constructs like cities or dungeons and irregular spaces like forests or mountain passes. Has various toggleable layers for customized exports.
- Setting Scaffolder - Uses the above to generate entire locations set with NPC's and relationships between them.

# Additional Future Features

- Campaign Manager - Create a campaign and add details, NPC's, maps, etc to them for better organization of created data.
- Quest Scaffolder - Create mini-quests with basic characters, key items, and points of interest being spread across existing settings and the NPC's within them.
- Player Character Creator - Create

# Data Persistence

For now the plan is to use local storage as well as including the ability to export a file that can later be imported if needed.
